Question and Answering via LangChain + Chroma Vector dataBase and OpenAI

In the realm of AI-native applications, significant advancements have been made by Chroma DB and Langchain. Chroma DB serves as an open-source embedding (vector) database, designed to offer efficient, scalable, and adaptable solutions for storing and searching embeddings. On the other hand, Langchain stands out as a comprehensive framework tailored for the development of applications fueled by language models.

If you recall our previous blog post where we explored Langchain's capabilities alongside the Pinecone Vector Database, today, we shift our focus to showcase Chroma DB. Why? Because Chroma DB, being an open-source default vector database, is the preferred choice utilized by Langchain, garnering noteworthy popularity in recent times.

Within this blog post, we will delve into the utilization of Chroma DB for semantic search, leveraging the utilities provided by Langchain. Our discussion will specifically cover topics such as indexing documents, retrieving semantically similar documents, implementing persistence, integrating Large Language Models (LLMs), and employing question-answering and retriever chains.

Harnessing the capabilities of Langchain and Chroma DB empowers developers to craft advanced applications driven by large language models, adept at managing intricate information retrieval tasks. This synergy unlocks the potential to build AI-native applications that harness the strength of vector databases and language models.

We trust that this guide has proven informative and valuable on your path to crafting AI-native applications. Always remember, the potential of AI is within your grasp. Keep exploring and keep innovating!
